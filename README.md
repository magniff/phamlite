# Phamlite
### About
Inspired by [Phamerator](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-12-395) released in 2011 by the Hatfull lab, Phamlite is a simple and easy python based tool that can visualize several input phage genomes. Phamlite uses MMseqs2 to rapidly classify phage gene families and parallelized BLASTn for pairwise nucleotide identity. Synteny between phages can quickly be determined.

### Requirements
- Input genome files (genbank format)

### How to use
Add the [phamlite](https://console.latch.bio/explore/61249/info) workflow to your latch account
